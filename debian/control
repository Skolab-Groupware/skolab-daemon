Description: Skolab Groupware server daemon
 Skolab is the continuation of the Kolab 2 groupware. It is a secure,
 scalable, and reliable groupware server. It consists of a number of
 well-known and proven components for the standard tasks such as e-mail,
 directory service, and web service. Skolab adds intelligent interaction
 between the components, a web administration interface, management of
 free/busy lists, etc. Various clients can access Skolab, among them
 Kontact (KDE), Thunderbird (Mozilla) and Horde (web).
 .
 This package contains the groupware server program, the LDAP gateway
 daemon, as well as the dependencies and documentation to run Skolab.
