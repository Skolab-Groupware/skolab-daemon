# Documentation to install Skolab on Debian

The Skolab groupware server system consists of several interacting
parts that need to be configured to work together.  They include the
LDAP server, the SMTP server, the IMAP server, and the web server, as
well as the Skolab server itself.  The Skolab configuration scripts want
to reconfigure some of these services without much regard to what else
they might be doing.  So to try this out, it is advisable to use a
completely separate test system or a virtual machine at first.  Once
you have developed an acceptable setup, you can transfer the
configuration files to the production system.

## Clients

The Skolab packages do not come with end-user client programs.  The
following programs are the primary available Skolab clients:

  * KDE Client: Kontact (Debian package kontact)
  * Microsoft Outlook with proprietary connector

The following programs among others provide limited or experimental
support for Skolab:

  * Horde (Debian package horde3)
  * Mozilla Thunderbird (Debian package thunderbird)

for more information.

## Installation

Install this skolabd package with all dependencies:

```
 apt-get install skolab-daemon postfix slapd
```

(postfix conflicts with exim4, so it may be necessary to mention it
explicitly to convince apt-get to install it.  slapd must be installed
unless you already have an LDAP server elsewhere and know how to
access it.  The skolabd package depends on all remaining necessary
packages.)

Or you use

```
 aptitude install skolab-daemon
```

which will figure all this out automatically.

If you want to setup slaves, on the master, set ''SLAPD_SERVICES'' in
''/etc/default/slapd'' and run ''/etc/init.d/slapd restart'':

```
 SLAPD_SERVICES="ldap://127.0.0.1:389/ ldaps:/// ldapi:///"
```

If you want to enable ''imaps'', uncomment the following line in
''/etc/cyrus.conf'' and run ''/etc/init.d/skolab-cyrus restart'':

```
 imaps          cmd="imapd -s -U 30" listen="imaps" prefork=0 maxchild=100
```

## Bootstrap

Stop all daemons:

```
 /etc/init.d/apache2 stop
 /etc/init.d/skolab-daemon stop
 /etc/init.d/skolab-cyrus stop
 /etc/init.d/postfix stop
 /etc/init.d/saslauthd stop
 /etc/init.d/slapd stop
 /etc/init.d/amavis stop #optionally
```

Run:

```
 skolab_bootstrap -b
```

(This will ask you a number of questions and overwrite several
configuration files in your system based on the answers.  You can check
in /etc/skolab/templates/ for which files might be overwritten in what
way.)

After skolab_bootstrap has finished, you can start all the daemons
again:

```
 /etc/init.d/amavis start #optionally
 /etc/init.d/slapd start
 /etc/init.d/saslauthd start
 /etc/init.d/postfix start
 /etc/init.d/skolab-cyrus start
 /etc/init.d/skolab-daemon start
 /etc/init.d/apache2 start
```

You can test afterwards whether authentication is working as expected
by using the testsaslauthd command, e.g.,

```
 testsaslauthd -u manager -p PASSWORD
```

(using the password that you configured in skolab_bootstrap.)

## Web administration frontend

If you want the Web Administration frontend, install the package
skolab-webadmin and follow its README.Debian file for setup
instructions.

 apt-get install skolab-webadmin

## Enabling TLS for IMAP

If you are planning to use the Toltec Groupware Connector, you will
also need to enable TLS with Cyrus.

```
 openssl req -new -nodes -out req.pem -keyout key.pem  
 openssl rsa -in key.pem -out new.key.pem
 openssl x509 -in req.pem -out ca-cert -req -signkey new.key.pem -days 999 

 cp new.key.pem /etc/ssl/certs/cyrus.pem
 rm new.key.pem
 cat ca-cert >> /etc/ssl/certs/cyrus.pem

 chown cyrus:mail /etc/ssl/certs/cyrus.pem
 chmod 600 /etc/ssl/certs/cyrus.pem  # Your key should be protected.
```

Edit /etc/imapd.conf and change the following lines:

```
 tls_ca_file: /etc/ssl/certs/cyrus.pem
 tls_cert_file: /etc/ssl/certs/cyrus.pem
 tls_key_file: /etc/ssl/certs/cyrus.pem
```

== Troubleshooting ==

If there are strange DB_ERROR entries in the /var/log/mail.log file
related to some problems with the ptloader from the skolab-cyrus, it
helps to create the directory /var/lib/cyrus/ptclient.  But this
shouldn't be the case, and we will keep an eye on this bug.
