Invitation Forwarding
---------------------

Microsoft Outlook acts a little peculiar when forwarding iCal
invitation messages. Such messages are just passed on to the new
recipient without having headers modified. This causes such messages
to be rejected by the Skolab server.

As a solution to this problem the mail filter on the server can
capture such messages and embed them as an attachment to an email
message with valid headers and a short description that the message is
forwarded.

Because some Outlook versions delete the Organizer attribute,
this attribute will be added again with the value from the "from" value
that Outlook had passed unmodified and thus should contain the email
of the event's organizer.

Additionally, some versions of Outlook are incapable of recognizing
non-ascii characters in such forwarded messages, so the filter rewrites
common non-ascii characters to ascii (for example "o-umlaut" to "oe").

resmgr.conf.template has an option for allowing or disallowing
"Outlook forwarding". Set

$conf['skolab']['filter']['allow_outlook_ical_forward']  = true;

to enable (default) or

$conf['skolab']['filter']['allow_outlook_ical_forward']  = false;

to disable.
