Virus- and spam-filter setup for Skolab
=======================================

Last edited: $Id$

Introduction
------------

The Skolab server uses amavisd[1] in conjunction with clamav[2] and
spamassassin[3] to filter email for spam and virus.


Goal
----

To have a virus-filter that, if a virus is found, notifies the sender
of the virus if and only if the sender is a local user. 

To prevent "backscatter" the Skolab server should never send such
notifications to non-local users. If a virus is blocked by the filter
and originates from a non-local user, a notification should be sent to
the local user who would have been the recipient of the email
containing the virus if it had not been infected.

Any infected email that is blocked from reaching it's recipient is
archived to @localstatedir@/amavisd/virusmails on the server.

Spam-handling is different: Spam is not blocked by the filter, but
instead email potentially is spam is marked with the

X-Spam-Status: Yes, <reason...>
X-Spam-Flag: YES

headers to allow for easy server- and/or client-side filtering of
spam.

Configuration
-------------

The relevant parts of the amavisd.conf.template that apply to all
users are:

$final_virus_destiny      = D_DISCARD;  # (defaults to D_BOUNCE)
$final_banned_destiny     = D_DISCARD;  # (defaults to D_BOUNCE)
$final_spam_destiny       = D_PASS;  # (defaults to D_REJECT)
$viruses_that_fake_sender_re = new_RE();
@viruses_that_fake_sender_maps = ();
$warnvirusrecip = 1;    # (defaults to false (undef))
$warnbannedrecip = 1;   # (defaults to false (undef))
$QUARANTINEDIR = '@localstatedir@/amavisd/virusmails';
$virus_quarantine_to  = 'virus-quarantine';
@mynetworks = qw( @@@postfix-mynetworks@@@ );

In addition to that, a policy bank is defined that overrides some of
the above configuration in the case where the sender is a a local user[4]
who is using his legitimate address:

$policy_bank{'MYUSERS'} = {  # mail from authenticated users on this system
  # Bounce only to local users
  final_virus_destiny      => D_BOUNCE,
  final_banned_destiny     => D_BOUNCE,
  warnvirusrecip_maps => undef, # (defaults to false (undef))
  warnbannedrecip_maps => undef,# (defaults to false (undef))
  warnvirussender => 1,
  warnbannedsender => 1,
  mynetworks => qw(0.0.0.0/0),
};

So, in the default case, all virus mail is discarded from the mail
system (but still archived in the quarantine) and the recipient is
notified about the problem.

In the case where the sender is local, the recipient is not notified,
but instead the sender get a notification (a bounce with an
error-message) from the mail server.

Any local additions or changes to the configuration can of course also
make use of this destinction between local and non-local users by
adding to either the global part of the configuration and/or to the
MYUSERS policy bank.

    server, a "non-local user" is everyone else.
