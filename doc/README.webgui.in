Web admin interface for Skolab
==============================

Requirements
------------

This feature requires the skolab-webadmin package to be installed.

Configuration
-------------

There are only two aspects of the webgui that can be configured currently:

1) Access control based on user class. Each skolab user is member of one of the
user classes

 "user": Any regular skolab user.
 "maintainer": A user that can create/modify/delete user accounts,
        addressbook entries and distribution lists.
 "admin": Same as "maintainer" but with the additional rights to
        change services configuration and manage maintainers.
 "manager": The "manager" class contains only one user -- the manager
        user. The right are the same as "admin".

By default all classes can use the webgui. By changing
@sysconfdir@/skolab/templates/session_vars.php this can be
configured. The user-classes that should have access to the webgui
are listed in the $params['allow_user_classes'] array:

$params['allow_user_classes'] =
        array( 'user', 'admin', 'maintainer', 'manager' );


2) Controlling access for regular users to the LDAP attributes of the
user's account object. It is possible to change which LDAP attributes
are shown to users on the user page. For each attribute in the user
form, an entry in the array $params['attribute_access'] in
@sysconfdir@/skolab/templates/session_vars.php can be made. The key
of the entry is the attribute's name and the value is one of

  "ro": Readonly.
  "rw": Read/write.
  "hidden": Attribute will not be shown.
  "mandatory": Attribute must not be empty when edited.

The names of the attributes visible to regular users are:

  givenname, sn, password, mail, uid, skolabhomeserver, accttype,
  skolabinvitationpolicy, title, alias, skolabdelegate, o, ou,
  roomNumber, street, postOfficeBox, postalCode, l, c, telephoneNumber,
  facsimileTelephoneNumber, skolabFreeBusyFuture.

An example showing how to make title and telephoneNumber readonly and
hide the c (country) attribute:

$param['attribute_access'] = array( 'title' => 'ro',
                                    'telephoneNumber' => 'ro',
                                    'c' => 'hidden' );
